# LunarLander Deep RL: Deep Reinforcement Learning on Gym's LunarLander-v2
Welcome to LunarLander Deep RL, a project focused on the training of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to maneuver a lunar vehicle to safe landing using Gym's LunarLander-v2 environment.

## Project Overview
In this project, we train an AI agent to land a lunar vehicle in the LunarLander-v2 environment provided by OpenAI's gym.

The centerpiece of this project is the Deep Q-Network (DQN), a deep reinforcement learning algorithm first proposed by Mnih et al. in their 2015 paper. Our goal is to utilize this DQN to successfully guide a lunar lander to its landing pad.
